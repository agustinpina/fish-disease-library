## Overview

### What is SRS?

Salmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS), also known as Piscirickettsiosis, is a severe bacterial disease affecting salmonids, including Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*), coho salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*), and rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*). It is caused by *Piscirickettsia salmonis*, a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterium that was the first "rickettsia-like" pathogen identified in fish [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [19](https://www.marcosgodoy.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=220:piscirickettsia-salmonis-patogeno-intracelular-facultativo-observaciones-en-medios-solidos&catid=150:diagnostico&Itemid=469&lang=es).

First identified in Chile in 1989 during a devastating outbreak in coho salmon, SRS has since become the most economically significant disease in Chilean salmon aquaculture. The 1989 outbreak killed approximately 1.5 million coho salmon, causing economic losses of $10 million USD. By 1990, the disease had spread to Atlantic salmon with mortality rates reaching 90% on some farms, and by 1995, annual losses had risen to $49 million USD [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia) [3](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70021948).

Today, SRS is responsible for over $700 million USD in annual losses in Chile and accounts for 52.8% of all infectious disease mortality in Atlantic salmon (2022). The disease has also been reported in Norway, Canada, Scotland, and Ireland, though with considerably lower incidence and economic impact than in Chile [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11980539/) [5](https://www.aquafeed.com/newsroom/reports/chile-publishes-annual-reports-on-aquaculture-health-status-and-antimicrobial-use/).

## Clinical Signs of SRS

### Common Signs

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Darkened Coloration:** Affected fish exhibit an overall darkening of the skin [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia) [17](https://marcosgodoy.com/presentacion-cutanea-de-la-piscirickettsiosis-piscirickettsia-salmonis-en-salmon-coho-oncorhynchus-kisutch-patologia-macroscopica/).
    - **Anemia and Pale Gills:** Severe anemia leading to pale gills is a hallmark sign [6](https://aquatechcenter.com/disease_challenge/salmon-rickettsial-syndrome-srs/) [18](https://marcosgodoy.com/index.php?Itemid=503&catid=9:uncategorised&id=157:es-septicemia-rickettsial-salmonidea-srs-en-salmon-del-atlantico-salmo-salar-iv-presentacion-clinica-patologica-visceral&lang=en&option=com_content&view=article).
    - **Hemorrhages and Skin Lesions:** Petechial hemorrhages, vesicles with scale elevations, and skin ulcers with underlying muscle hemorrhages [6](https://aquatechcenter.com/disease_challenge/salmon-rickettsial-syndrome-srs/) [17](https://marcosgodoy.com/presentacion-cutanea-de-la-piscirickettsiosis-piscirickettsia-salmonis-en-salmon-coho-oncorhynchus-kisutch-patologia-macroscopica/).
    - **Swollen Organs:** Enlarged kidneys and spleen upon internal examination [6](https://aquatechcenter.com/disease_challenge/salmon-rickettsial-syndrome-srs/) [18](https://marcosgodoy.com/index.php?Itemid=503&catid=9:uncategorised&id=157:es-septicemia-rickettsial-salmonidea-srs-en-salmon-del-atlantico-salmo-salar-iv-presentacion-clinica-patologica-visceral&lang=en&option=com_content&view=article).
    - **Liver Lesions:** Ring-shaped, cream-colored liver lesions in chronic cases; pale and mottled livers [6](https://aquatechcenter.com/disease_challenge/salmon-rickettsial-syndrome-srs/) [18](https://marcosgodoy.com/index.php?Itemid=503&catid=9:uncategorised&id=157:es-septicemia-rickettsial-salmonidea-srs-en-salmon-del-atlantico-salmo-salar-iv-presentacion-clinica-patologica-visceral&lang=en&option=com_content&view=article).
    - **Scale Loss and Fin Fraying:** External degradation of scales and fins [6](https://aquatechcenter.com/disease_challenge/salmon-rickettsial-syndrome-srs/) [17](https://marcosgodoy.com/presentacion-cutanea-de-la-piscirickettsiosis-piscirickettsia-salmonis-en-salmon-coho-oncorhynchus-kisutch-patologia-macroscopica/).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming [27](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-024-01356-0) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and significant weight loss [27](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-024-01356-0) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - **Respiratory Distress:** Increased gill movement and labored breathing [27](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-024-01356-0) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - **Surface Swimming:** Fish congregating near the water surface [27](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-024-01356-0) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).

**Progression of Clinical Signs**

- **Early Stages:** Subtle signs such as reduced feed intake and slight lethargy. The disease can be insidious with initially low mortality. SRS mortality risk has a strong seasonal component, with mortalities significantly higher in warmer seasons [28](https://doi.org/10.1111/jfd.70097) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
- **Advanced Stages:** Pronounced physical signs including severe anemia, internal hemorrhages, organ enlargement, and characteristic liver lesions. Acute outbreaks can cause mortality rates of 30-90%. Co-infected fish (LF-89 + EM-90) showed only 24.1% survival at 21 days compared to 40.3% for single EM-90 infection [27](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-024-01356-0) [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11980539/) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
- **Impact on Fish Health:** SRS severely compromises immune function and overall vitality. Average cumulative mortality during an 18-month saltwater production cycle is approximately 20% [27](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-024-01356-0) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).

### Causes of SRS

**Etiology**

- **Causative Agent:** *Piscirickettsia salmonis*, a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterium, typically 0.5-1.5 μm in diameter. Originally described as obligate intracellular, it is now recognized as a facultative intracellular pathogen capable of growth in cell-free media. It was the first "rickettsia-like" bacterium to be recognized as a pathogen of fish [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [19](https://www.marcosgodoy.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=220:piscirickettsia-salmonis-patogeno-intracelular-facultativo-observaciones-en-medios-solidos&catid=150:diagnostico&Itemid=469&lang=es).

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Horizontal Transmission:** Direct water-borne transmission; the bacterium can survive several weeks at 5-20°C in saltwater. Entry occurs through intact skin and gills [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - **Vertical Transmission:** Possible transmission through eggs via an adhesion complex that allows pathogen entry [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - **Vector Transmission:** Sea lice coinfection significantly exacerbates disease severity and can override vaccine protection [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/).

**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Water temperatures between 9-16°C increase disease risk. Low oxygen conditions and harmful algal blooms predispose fish to infection [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [5](https://www.aquafeed.com/newsroom/reports/chile-publishes-annual-reports-on-aquaculture-health-status-and-antimicrobial-use/). 
- **Farm Management Practices:** High stocking densities, overcrowding, chemical delousing treatments, and net fouling that reduces oxygen availability all increase susceptibility [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/).

### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Gross lesion examination with observation of characteristic darkened coloration, swollen organs, and ring-shaped liver lesions. Hepatic nodules (moderate and severe) are strongly associated with EM-90-like infection specifically [17](https://marcosgodoy.com/presentacion-cutanea-de-la-piscirickettsiosis-piscirickettsia-salmonis-en-salmon-coho-oncorhynchus-kisutch-patologia-macroscopica/) [18](https://marcosgodoy.com/index.php?Itemid=503&catid=9:uncategorised&id=157:es-septicemia-rickettsial-salmonidea-srs-en-salmon-del-atlantico-salmo-salar-iv-presentacion-clinica-patologica-visceral&lang=en&option=com_content&view=article) [21](https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens12030450).

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Real-Time qPCR:** The gold standard for *P. salmonis* detection. Bayesian analysis shows qPCR sensitivity is 5- to 30-fold greater than bacterial culture, with median sensitivity of 83.5-97.6% depending on disease stage. High specificity and rapid turnaround make qPCR suitable for both surveillance and outbreak diagnosis [20](https://doi.org/10.1111/jfd.13226).
    - **Genogroup-Specific qPCR:** Essential for differentiating LF-89-like and EM-90-like genogroups, which have different virulence profiles and vaccination implications. Co-infection surveillance requires genogroup-level detection [21](https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens12030450).
    - **Multiplex PCR Genotyping:** Targets genogroup-specific genes (MFS transporter, Nitronate monooxygenase for LF-89; Aldehyde dehydrogenase, Acid phosphatase for EM-90). Achieves 100% specificity with no cross-reactivity against 10 other fish pathogens [22](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.673216).
    - **LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification):** Rapid on-site diagnostic method operating at constant temperature (60-65°C) without specialized equipment. Sensitivity and specificity comparable to real-time PCR. Can differentiate LF-89 and EM-90 genogroups using Nitronate monooxygenase and Acid phosphatase targets respectively [23](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1392808).
    - **Cell Culture Isolation:** *P. salmonis* can be isolated in cell culture (CHSE-214, RTS11) with optimal growth at 15-18°C. However, culture sensitivity is significantly lower than molecular methods [20](https://doi.org/10.1111/jfd.13226).
    - **Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Technique (IFAT):** Used for detection and identification of the bacterium in tissue samples [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - **Immunohistochemistry:** Detection of *P. salmonis* antigens in tissue sections, useful for confirming infection in histological samples [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of tissue sections to assess pathological changes including granulomatous inflammation and bacterial inclusions within macrophages [18](https://marcosgodoy.com/index.php?Itemid=503&catid=9:uncategorised&id=157:es-septicemia-rickettsial-salmonidea-srs-en-salmon-del-atlantico-salmo-salar-iv-presentacion-clinica-patologica-visceral&lang=en&option=com_content&view=article).

**Genogroup Identification**

- **Importance of Genogroup Differentiation:** LF-89-like became the most prevalent genogroup in Chilean salmon aquaculture between 2017-2021, while EM-90-like is associated with specific hepatic lesions. Current EM-90-based vaccines show incomplete cross-protection against LF-89, making genogroup identification critical for vaccination strategy [21](https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens12030450) [22](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.673216).

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing SRS from Other Diseases:** It is crucial to differentiate SRS from other conditions with similar clinical presentations, including Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) which causes similar hemorrhaging, Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD) which also involves kidney pathology, furunculosis, and Tenacibaculosis which generates similar skin lesions [6](https://aquatechcenter.com/disease_challenge/salmon-rickettsial-syndrome-srs/).

- **Chilean Regulatory Requirement (Sernapesca Resolution 1606/2021):** In Chile, PCR-based discrimination between SRS and Tenacibaculosis is mandatory. The updated Tenacibaculosis definition requires *Tenacibaculum* spp. identification by PCR, with external signs (fin erosion, oral/rostral lesions with yellow pigmentation, gill ulcers with yellowish coloration), **and explicitly excludes cases showing evident lesions of Piscirickettsiosis or Renibacteriosis**. This regulatory requirement addresses the high co-occurrence of these pathogens, ensuring proper epidemiological classification [24](https://www.sernapesca.cl/noticias/sernapesca-actualiza-definicion-de-enfermedad-tenacibaculosis/).

- **Differentiating Clinical Signs:**
    - **Piscirickettsiosis:** Characteristic ring-shaped liver lesions (cream/yellow), internal granulomatous lesions in viscera, kidney and spleen enlargement. Skin ulcers are secondary to systemic infection [17](https://marcosgodoy.com/presentacion-cutanea-de-la-piscirickettsiosis-piscirickettsia-salmonis-en-salmon-coho-oncorhynchus-kisutch-patologia-macroscopica/) [18](https://marcosgodoy.com/index.php?Itemid=503&catid=9:uncategorised&id=157:es-septicemia-rickettsial-salmonidea-srs-en-salmon-del-atlantico-salmo-salar-iv-presentacion-clinica-patologica-visceral&lang=en&option=com_content&view=article).
    - **Tenacibaculosis:** External ulcerative lesions with yellow pigmentation, mouth erosion, fin necrosis, tail rot. Body and caudal fin lesions (*T. maritimum*) or head/snout lesions (*T. dicentrarchi*). **No characteristic visceral lesions** [25](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2022.1068000).

**Bacterial Consortia in Skin Ulcers**

- **Core Pathobiome:** Research has identified a complex bacterial consortium in Atlantic salmon skin ulcers during *P. salmonis* infection. The primary pathobiome consists of *P. salmonis*, *Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi*, and *Aliivibrio wodanis*, with *Vibrio* spp. enriched on infected gills. Four bacterial families are overrepresented in ulcerated tissue: Vibrionaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Piscirickettsiacea, and Pseudomonadaceae [26](https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14010097).

- **Co-infection Implications:** The presence of this bacterial consortium may enhance *P. salmonis* pathogenicity through cooperative interactions. When diagnosing skin ulcers, clinicians should consider that multiple pathogens may be present simultaneously, requiring molecular methods (multiplex PCR) to identify primary vs. opportunistic agents [26](https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14010097).  

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Antibiotics:** Florfenicol is the primary antibiotic used, accounting for 87-97% of antimicrobial use for SRS in Chile. Oxytetracycline is also employed. In 2024, 351.1 tons of antibiotics were used in Chilean salmon aquaculture (9.7% increase from 2023), with over 96% directed at SRS control. The first half of 2024 showed a 22.6% increase compared to the same period in 2023 [7](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/antibiotics-chilean-salmon-farming-florfenicol/srs-pushed-chilean-salmon-farming-antibiotic-use-up-by-97-last-year/1968326) [8](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/57645).
    - **PROA-Salmon Certification:** As of 2024, PROA-Salmon certified harvests represent 28.7% of production volume, with 34.5% of certified production being antibiotic-free. The industry's 50% antibiotic reduction target by 2025 is unlikely to be met [5](https://www.aquafeed.com/newsroom/reports/chile-publishes-annual-reports-on-aquaculture-health-status-and-antimicrobial-use/).
    - **Treatment Protocol:** Florfenicol at 20 mg/kg body weight for 15 days is the optimized dosing regimen [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513110/).
    - **In Vitro Sensitivity:** *P. salmonis* shows sensitivity to streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and oxytetracycline in laboratory conditions [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).

- **Treatment Challenges:** 
    - Medicated feed to control intracellular pathogens has proven largely unsuccessful due to difficulty achieving sufficient intracellular antibiotic concentrations [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia) [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848619304120).
    - Treatment failure is common; farms with lower mortality when therapy is initiated have better outcomes [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848619304120).

- **Vaccines:**
    - Approximately 34 commercial vaccines are licensed in Chile, with 94% injectable, 2% oral, and 1% immersion formulations [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/).
    - The best-performing vaccine reduced mortality by only 22% compared to reference vaccination regimens [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/).
    - Vaccine protection peaks at 600-800 degree-days post-vaccination and declines to pre-vaccination levels by 1800-1900 degree-days [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/).

- **Why Vaccines Fail:**
    - *P. salmonis* employs sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms including intracellular survival within host cell vacuoles, cytokine manipulation (inhibiting IL-12 while inducing IL-10), and Type IV secretion system that inhibits phagosome-lysosome fusion [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/).
    - Current vaccines do not activate the cellular-mediated immune responses necessary to control intracellular pathogens [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/).

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Early removal of mortalities and diseased fish to reduce infection pressure. Chile's General Sanitary Program for Mortality Management (PSGM) standardizes procedures for classification, handling, and safe disposal of fish mortalities [28](https://doi.org/10.1111/jfd.70097) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - Broodstock screening and rejection of positive eggs [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - Individual egg batch incubation to prevent cross-contamination [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).

- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Reduced stocking densities to decrease stress and transmission [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - Site fallowing periods to break the infection cycle [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - Control of sea lice coinfection which overrides vaccine protection. While Caligus infestation levels increased significantly over the years, SRS mortality risk remained constant, suggesting complex interactions [28](https://doi.org/10.1111/jfd.70097) [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/).
    - Broodstock injection with antibiotics before seawater departure [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).

### Case Studies

**Real-World Examples**

- **Notable Outbreaks:**
    - **Chile (1989):** The first identified outbreak occurred in coho salmon, killing approximately 1.5 million fish and causing $10 million USD in economic losses. This was the first recognition of *P. salmonis* as a fish pathogen [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia) [3](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70021948).
    - **Chile (1990):** The disease spread to Atlantic salmon with mortality rates reaching up to 90% on some farms [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/salmonid-rickettsial-septicaemia).
    - **Chile (2007-2009):** SRS contributed to a major aquaculture crisis alongside ISA outbreaks, devastating the Chilean salmon industry [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11980539/).
    - **Chile (2024):** Environmental events including low oxygen levels and harmful algal blooms in Los Lagos and Aysén regions caused mortality peaks in January, with stable overall levels compared to previous years [5](https://www.aquafeed.com/newsroom/reports/chile-publishes-annual-reports-on-aquaculture-health-status-and-antimicrobial-use/).

- **Lessons Learned:** The importance of integrated disease management combining biosecurity, stress reduction, sea lice control, and early intervention. The limited efficacy of current vaccines highlights the need for continued research into cellular immune responses and novel vaccine approaches [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9714679/) [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11980539/).

## Conclusion

Salmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS) remains the most significant threat to Chilean salmon aquaculture, with annual losses exceeding $700 million USD and driving the majority of antibiotic use in the industry. Despite 34 commercially available vaccines, their limited long-term efficacy (best showing only 22% mortality reduction) and the bacterium's sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms continue to pose major challenges.

Effective SRS management requires an integrated approach combining robust biosecurity protocols, early detection, stress reduction, sea lice control, and judicious antibiotic use. Ongoing research into cellular immune responses and novel vaccine approaches offers hope for improved control strategies. By implementing comprehensive disease management programs and supporting continued research, fish health managers and veterinarians can work toward reducing the devastating impact of SRS on salmon aquaculture operations.
