## Overview

### What is SRS? 
Tenacibaculosis is a bacterial disease affecting various fish species in aquaculture, including Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), and marine species such as sea bass (_Dicentrarchus labrax_) and sea bream (_Sparus aurata_). It is caused by the bacterium _Tenacibaculum maritimum_, leading to skin ulcers, fin erosion, and high mortality rates, resulting in significant economic losses. The disease was first identified in Japan in the 1970s and has since been reported in many countries worldwide, including Norway, Chile, and the United States [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683696/).
